# Stock-Analysis
VBA
## Overview of Project
This project was intended to help Steve analyze stocks to better help his parents with their financial decisions. He wanted to examine each stock by looking at their annual volume and return to make a more informed decision. 

## Results
When looking at the stocks in 2017 and 2018, we can see that the large majority of stocks in 2017 had positve returns. Four stocks (DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG) even had a return percentage that was greater than 100%. One of which, DQ, was the stock that Steve's parents were interested in. Only the stock, TERP, had a negative return. However, in 2018 all but two stocks did not perform well and had a negative return. The performance of the stocks for both years can be seen below to gain a better understanding.

Once the code was refactored the run times could be seen to take place at a much faster speed.
## Summary
### Advantages/Disadvantages of Refactoring code
Advantages of refactoring code is that it allows the code to become more efficient and perform more quickly. This is useful for when analyzing mass amounts of data.

Although there are many benefits, there are some disadvantages as well. Refactoring may make it more difficult to find an error as it is more complicated. 
### How do these pros/cons apply to refactoring the original script?
